# Recoiler

[Work in progress] Shooting video game based on Physics. Made in Unity, C#.

# Technologies

Developed using:
- C# Language
- Unity 2021

# Idea and development

This video game is designed to explore the development of a physics video game that combines the platform and shooter genres.

The challenge proposed is to use the weapon's recoil to replace movement mechanics, such as: multi-jump, dash, levitation, etc.

# Implementation

Physics-based character control was created, and the player was given the ability to switch between a set of weapons that are later used to complete platforming levels.

If a weapon is fired, the recoil of the weapon will generate a force in the opposite direction that will move the player.
Allowing various levels of platforming that will require the use of weapons with different fire rates and recoils.

*You can see the code [here](Assets/_Scripts/).*
